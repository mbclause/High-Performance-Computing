exercise_1.cu - Usage: ./a.out
This CUDA program uses a global function to compute the number of even values in a given NxN matrix, N being 16.

exercise_2.cu - Usage: .a/.out
This CUDA program uses a global function to compute the square of a given NxN matrix, N being 16.
For example, if the matrix given is A with 16x16 elements, the host function will compute the matrix AxA.
